            <p>I'm currently learning to be a Professional Software Developer with 
                <a href="https://codeclan.com/courses/professional-software-development/">CodeClan.</a>
                So far I've developed a solo Inventory Management App using python, flask, postgresSQL, css and html. 
                We're currently working towards developing our JavaScript knowledge with the project approaching in the next few weeks 
                giving us the opportunity to showcase our React knowledge.
